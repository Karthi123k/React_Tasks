Init the npm
Cmd-> npm init,
Inti the package cmd  -> npm install -D parcel
What does caret explain?
Using a caret (^) sign means that we can accept minor releases and patch releases, but not a major release when updating our package.
What is package.json?
The package. json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version, and dependencies. The file provides the npm package manager with various information to help identify the project and handle dependencies.
What  is package-lock.json?
package-lock. json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed. It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.

Install react cmd->npm install react
Install reactDOM cmd->npm i react-dom
Execute the code with this cmd-> npx parcel index.html
Remove the react cdn links 

Import the react in app.js
import React from"react";
import ReactDOM from"react-dom/client";
And change the script type=module in index.html 

What is script and module?
Modules are the attempt to standardize a proper modern file format for JavaScript code. It deviates from scripts in some ways, most importantly in that it has dependency management built-in and executes the same resource only once
PARCEL USAGES
HMR-> hot module replacement 
using file watcher algorithm in c++  in parcel
. parcel -cache ->using the parcel while code execution
 Parcel builds the all file to support the host and runs in the local server in the dist folder.
Cmd-> npx parcel build index.html
Parcel bundling the js code
Parcel can cleaning the code-> remove the console logs
Dev and production build
Super fast build algorithm
Image optimization
Caching while development
Compression the code
Compatible with older version of browser
Https on dev
We want use https in local host in that time cmd-> npx parcel index.html - -https
Manage the port numbers
 We can  put the parcel cache in gitignore
In we write like this .parcel-cache
Consistent hashing algorithms
Parcel is zero config 


What is Transitive dependency?
A transitive dependency is a dependency of a package you depend on. Imagine the case of react . Your application depends on it (you listed it yourself in your manifest), so it's a direct dependency. But react also depends on prop-types !
